# Fix Frontend Issues

## Problem
The frontend is showing network errors and service worker issues:
- `FetchEvent for "<URL>" resulted in a network error response`
- `sw.js:23 Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Failed to fetch`
- Missing resources like `vite.svg`, `main.tsx`, `icon-192.png`

## Root Cause
These errors are caused by:
1. Browser cache containing old service worker files from a previous Vite project
2. Missing PWA manifest and icons
3. Service worker trying to fetch non-existent resources

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated Layout with Proper Meta Tags
- Added proper mobile web app meta tags
- Fixed deprecated `apple-mobile-web-app-capable` warning
- Added PWA manifest link

### 2. Created PWA Manifest
- Added `manifest.json` with proper PWA configuration
- Created SVG icons for the app
- Set proper theme colors and display settings

### 3. Updated Next.js Configuration
- Disabled problematic service worker features
- Added security headers
- Configured proper PWA settings

### 4. Created Cache Clearing Script
- Added `clear-cache.js` to help clear browser cache

## How to Fix

### Option 1: Clear Browser Cache (Recommended)
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Go to Application tab
3. Click "Clear storage" or "Clear site data"
4. Refresh the page

### Option 2: Hard Refresh
1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
2. Or open incognito/private browsing window

### Option 3: Clear Service Workers
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Go to Application tab > Service Workers
3. Click "Unregister" for any service workers
4. Refresh the page

### Option 4: Use the Clear Cache Script
1. Open browser console (F12 > Console)
2. Copy and paste the contents of `frontend/clear-cache.js`
3. Press Enter
4. Refresh the page

## Verification
After clearing cache, you should see:
- No more service worker errors
- No more missing resource errors
- Proper PWA manifest loading
- Clean console without network errors

## Prevention
- Always clear browser cache when switching between different development setups
- Use incognito mode for testing to avoid cache issues
- Regularly clear service workers during development
